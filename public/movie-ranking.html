<h1>Greatest Movies, as told by MJ</h1>
    <h2>My current top 3 movies</h2>
<hr/>
        <h3>The Gentleman</h3>
            <p>This movie has a balance of comedy, action, and drama</p>
        <h3>Queen of the Damned</h3>
            <p>This movie has Aaliyah (RIP) and made me relize I do like some movies that are technically musicals.</p>
        <h3>Dune Part: 2</h3>
            <p>Has a lot of suspence when it comes to the "Hero" dreading what he inevitably has to do. It had more action than the first movie and the build up to the final scene was great!</p>
